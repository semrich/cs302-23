Pre/concurrent reading:

* Chapter 1 in M & S briefly reviews specification, design, analysis, testing
  and debugging.  These should not be new to you but still  make sure you look 
  over the C++ intro (first few pages) and the subsection on Big-Oh notation.  
  We likely will not specifically cover assertions and exception handling 
  Discussed in the middle of the chapter but  these are good to know about.

* If you haven’t already, you must read at least M&S section 2.1 (classes and 
  members), 2.3 (placing class in a separate file), 2.4 (separating interface 
  from implementation). 

  If you don’t understand after(re)reading the above please ask a question 
  on Piazza or during your lab period.

Overview of today/Chapter 2:

* Public vs. private functions/data members

* Brief discussion of separating interface from implementation

* NOTE! Only member functions should modify data members (we'll
cover rare exceptions later in the semester). This is also known as
encapsulation / data hiding throughout the text/this semester


Class refresher (moving into next week if needed)
——————————————

"Composite types" contain multiple elements.  In the C programming
language, to which you will be introduced later, it uses a struct to
group multiple variables, or pieces of data, together.

As you likely learned in CS140, in C++ classes can contain multiple
variables, and functions too.  Over the next few weeks we will call
these data  "data members" and the functions  "member functions".

Car analogy/code - gas pedal, brake, and steering wheel hide the 
complexity of what actually makes the car go, stop and turn, 
respectively.  We aim in this course to build reusable
pieces of software that are complicated in the inside but easy 
to use via its interfaces.  In a sense, this is also idea for a 
course that is a very high-level look at "abstract data types", 
or ADTs, that describe common data structures and algorithms. 
"Push" and "pop", for example, are stack operations that can be 
Developed in any underlying computer language: C, C++, Java, 
Pascal (yes, I am that old), etc.

C++ and its classes in particular are useful because it by design 
uses Objects to hide all the "gory" details.   In general, "real 
world" projects can involve hundreds (or even thousands!!) of classes 
and the standard template library (STL) and newer effort such as 
the Boost library maximize code reuse by the programming community.

Now the bad news; as groovy as classes are, we often need to build 
them from scratch during the semester.  Some classes come prebuilt.  
Others like the Car class we will design today we need to construct. 

Like CS140 and the newly rebooted CS102, the programs you develop
will in general have a handful of classes and files: 

*  Each class will be defined in a header file (a .h file)

*  The member functions will be defined in a separate file (a .cpp file)

*  You will compile your programs using a makefile (see directory 
   for an example)


Remember, classes enable a C++ program to model objects:
-  Attributes (data members)
-  Behaviors or operators (member functions)

C++ is *extensible* because we can develop classes with cool features, 
and such features are often termed user-defined types (unlike the 
defaults like int)

Each object, just like each car or anything we think of, has its own data.  
The functions themselves are shared, but that is for another day. BY DEFAULT, 
all members of a class are private unless specifically denoted 
by "public"

The main reason is functions and data should be private unless it can be 
shown the main function must use them, and in practice this is a pretty high
bar for C++ programmers (unlike in C).  Data members are typically private 
because we want to "hide" these from the program accessing them.  This is 
called data hiding.

Any function not needed by  the main function should also be made private.  
Although you may interchange public and private designations, it is considered 
good practice to group all of the public elements first followed by private 
elements.

Any function that *sets* data members are sometimes called mutators.  
We’ll call these set functions.

Similarly, any function that reads information stored in private 
data members are sometimes called accessors.  We’ll call these 
get functions.


A quick review of constructors:
---------------------------

Constructors are special functions that initialize the values of data 
members.  Constructors are often placed before other functions after the 
"public" designation.

Just like member functions, constructors can be "overloaded" i.e., 
different constructors based on different prototypes.  The compiler 
is smart enough to figure out which one to use based on the arguments.

Data members can not be initialized where they are defined.  So there are two options:

1.)  Use a constructor with hard-coded default values

2.)  Specify default parameters in a construction as follows in the prototype:

Time (int= 0, int = 0, int = 0);

and in the constructor:

Time::Time (int h, int m, int s) {
 
    ...

}

Scope
-----

Data members are at "class scope" i.e., they can be seen in the class but not 
elsewhere.  These are equivalent to global variables for the class.

Nonmember functions placed outside of a class are at file scope depending 
on their location.  For example, a function outside of a class in the main 
program can be seen by all classes if desired.  This is generally not needed, 
as most assignments will be contained completely in a class.  

Variables in a member function have block scope, just as they do in other 
functions

Scope, combined with constructors and set/get functions often lead to 
smaller programs/function calls.  For example, all initialization is taken 
care of by the constructor and all validation/error checking can be done 
by the get/set functions, eliminating the need to do these in the member 
functions.  Further, because data members have class scope, they do not 
have to be provided as arguments to member functions.


Deconstructors
------------

Deconstructors are used when variables go out of scope and clean up
the trash automatically.  You don't often need them 
if your class does not have dynamically allocated memory as
fundamental types (e.g., int, array) have their own deconstructors.

Deconstructors are deliminated by the ~ character preceding the name 
of the class

Deconstructors can not be overloaded and do not return values.
Just like constructors, a default empty deconstructor exists.  You 
should replace it, however, for "clean up" operations as needed 
(e.g., freeing allocated memory).

C++ has "new" instead of "malloc," and "delete" instead of "free".

Whenever you use new/delete you need a constructor and deconstructor.
We'll cover this in lab this week.

In general, deconstructors are run in the order of the original constructor calls
